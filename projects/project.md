### Current Projects
<hr>
#### Core machine intelligence algorithms

We primarily focus on overcoming the limitations of the current supervised machine learning framework. The first category we focus on is the **adaptive machine learning (AML)** schemes that deal with more challenging scenarios without large-scale labelled training data. The examples of those schemes include continual learning, meta/transfer learning, and self-supervised/unsupervised learning. The second focus category is the **trustworthy machine learning (TML)**  that make ML models more reliable and safe to use. Namely, we pursue to make ML algorithms more explainable, fair, bias-free, and robust. 


Some more concrete funded project regarding above topics includes the following:
- Multi-task / continual / incremental learning (Supported by [NRF]()(2021-2025), [IITP]() (2022-2027))  
- XAI with Causality/Few-Shot Learning (Supported by [IITP]()(2022-2027))
